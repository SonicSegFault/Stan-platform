# STAN Platform

This repository contains the full-stack platform for STAN, an NGO website with a custom Content Management System (CMS) designed for non-technical users.

The project is organized as a monorepo with two main parts:
- **STAN**: The public-facing website
- **CMS**: The backend and frontend for content management and admin controls

Each part has its own folder with detailed documentation, setup instructions, and technology stack.
